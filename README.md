Build your ribbon rack correctly.

Currently supports:
- USAF (https://www.afpc.af.mil/Recognition/Decorations-and-Ribbons/)
- AFROTC (http://patriotfiles.com/forum/showthread.php?t=116789)

### Mac Users:
There isn't a pre-built binary available since I don't have access to any Apple devices.
If you want to run it simply download the repository and run `ribbonrack.py`.
